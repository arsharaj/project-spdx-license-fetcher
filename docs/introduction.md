## What is SPDX License Fetcher ?

The term **SPDX license fetcher** refers to a tool or utility designed to retrieve and manage software license information in compliance with the **SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange)** standard. SPDX is a widely adopted specification that provides a standardized way to document and share software package information, including licensing details.

Here's a breakdown of the key components involved :

1. **SPDX Standard** : SPDX is a set of standards developed by the Linux Foundation to facilitate the sharing of software package metadata, particularly licensing information. It provides a common format for communicating the licenses under which software is distributed, helping to ensure compliance and reduce the risk of legal issues.
2. **License Information** : Software projects are often distributed under various open-source licenses, each with its own terms and conditions. Properly documenting these licenses is crucial for legal and compliance reasons.
3. **Fetcher Tool** : A license fetcher tool automates the process of retreiving license information for software packages. This tool typically scans the source code or package metadata, identifies the licenses, and outputs the information in a standardized format, such as an SPDX file.

### Functions of SPDX License Fetcher :

- **Scanning Source Code** : The fetcher can scan the source code of a software project to detect license declarations within files.
- **Parsing Metadata** : It can parse package management files (e.g. package.json, pom.xml, etc) to extract license information.
- **Generating SPDX Files** : The tool outputs the gathered license information in a SPDX compliant format, which can be used for documentation and compliance checks.
- **Automation** : By automating the license retrieval process, it helps developers and organizations maintain accurate and up to date license information without manual effort.

### Benefits :

- **Compliance** : Ensures that all software components are properly licensed and compliant with legal requirements.
- **Transparency** : Provides clear and standardized documentation of license information.
- **Efficiency** : Saves time and reduces errors by automating the license information retrieval process.

In summary, an SPDX license fetcher is a valuable tool for managing software licenses in a 
consistent and standardized manner, aligning with the SPDX specification to facilitate legal 
compliance and transparency.
